   <h4 align="center"> Abstract: </h4>
  <font size="4"> With the advent of computing abilities, the Text-to-Speech (TTS) community has achieved
high quality speech synthesis in the recent past. However, the existing speech synthesisers
still lack the human-ness in many ways. This refers to the additional information such as age,
gender, emotional state of the person, to name a few. All this information is collectively called
the extra-linguistic or the paralinguistic information. Now that we have achieved very good
speech synthesis, the research community is focussed on delivering this paralinguistic
information along with the speech through the synthesisers. Nevertheless, there is still a
significant research gap in terms of evaluating the synthesisers that are developed for
different application domains.
Through our work, we investigate the perceptual dimensions contributing to the social
speaker characteristics warmth and competence in the generated speech. We perform this
study on various Neural end-to-end TTS systems. Therefore, through this project, we will
explore domain-specific perceptual acceptance of state-of-the art TTS systems. For its study,
we would focus on the application domains, health care and customer service.</font></h4>
